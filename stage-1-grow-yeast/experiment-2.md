# Experiment 2

## Purpose

Continue debugging growth of yeast in the sacramento setup to ensure that
reproducible colony numbers, colony morphologies, and colony color are
feasible moving forward for the experiment.

### Specific foci of attention
- double-checking calculations for media, since the colors were not correct.
- can I prevent "dark YPD-agar" by carefully agitating the agar first?

## Methods

### Media making

09 Feb 2021
made 2x 100 mL batches of YP(A)D Media

steps:
- 60g/L of YP(A)D ~ 6g/100 mL, so added 10 1g capsule to 200 mL of water
  (sacramento tap).
- 0.004% adenine hemisulfate ~ 40 mg/L => 8 mg.
- into one 500 mL Fernbach Flask.
- set aside one empty 500 mL Fernbach Flask.
- made origami hat with reynold's wrap for both.

other stuff:

- 100 mL YPD-Agar (6g), origami hat
- 3x empty Eppendorf tubes, origami pouch
- 100 mL plastic graduated cylinder, origami hat

### Autoclaving

see [standard procedure](experiment-1.md#Autoclaving)

### Inoculation & Growth

- cleanly transferred ~100 mL YP(A)D into empty F.F, set aside 10 mL into
  a sterile falcon tube, set aside one flask of YP(A)D for later.
- poured 4x ~20mL YPD-Agar into 10 cm petri dish, followed by flaming with
  a propane torch to remove air bubbles.

Noted that the media colors met expectations, all of them were a rich golden
color.

- once cooled, inoculated the F.F. with HA12(a) yeast strain from previous experiment.
  during the main experiment, we won't chain the yeast strains, but for now this is
  acceptable.  A preliminary experiment with glycerol stocks will be done at some
  point.
- placed the HA12(a)@YPD in incubator set to 30C, overnight, started CA 2300h
- stored petris in fridge

### Experimental Setup

10 Feb 2021

Noticeable cloudiness evolving in the YPD media.

- 1730h: inoculated 1 mL of the growth into the set aside 100 mL YPD F.F.
- 2030h: performed serial dilutions (200 uL into 800 uL pre-aliquoted from
  the set-aside 10 mL falcon into sterile Ep. tubes) of yeast growth (1x,
  5x, 25x, 125x) dilutions and plated all the YPD plate, by pipetting 200 uL
  from the dilution into the Petris and spreading with sterile plastic
  hockey stick.
