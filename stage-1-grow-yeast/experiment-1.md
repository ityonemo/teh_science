# Experiment 1

## Purpose

Begin debugging growth of yeast in the sacramento setup to ensure that
reproducible colony numbers, colony morphologies, and colony color are
feasible moving forward for the experiment.

## Methods

### Media making

08 Feb 2021
made 2x 100 mL batches of YP(A)D Media

steps:
- 3g/L of YP(A)D ~ 1g/300 mL, so added 1 1g capsule to 300 mL of water
  (sacramento tap).
- 0.004% adenine hemisulfate ~ 40 mg/L => 12 mg.
- into one 500 mL Fernbach Flask.
- set aside one empty 500 mL Fernbach Flask.
- made origami hat with reynold's wrap for both.

other stuff:

- 100 mL YPD-Agar (6g), origami hat
- 50 mL YP(A)D-Agar control (3g), origami hat
- 3x empty Eppendorf tubes, origami pouch
- 100 mL plastic graduated cylinder, origami hat

### Autoclaving

standard procedure:  using gas stove autoclaved on "power boil" setting
heat till 120 kpa, then reduced heat and let sit at pressure for 10 minutes,
then shut stove and wait to cool.

### Inoculation & Growth

- cleanly transferred 100 mL YP(A)D into empty F.F, set aside 10 mL into
  a sterile falcon tube, threw away remaining 100 mL for 2x 100mL F.F.
  Set aside one flask of YP(A)D for later.

- poured 1x ~20mL YP(A)D-Agar into 10 cm petri dish
- poured 3x ~20mL YPD-Agar into 10 cm petri dish

Noted that the color of the YP(A)D media appeared too light; the color of the
YPD agar was too dark and there appeared to be residual undissolved agar.  Did
I adequately mix it before autoclaving??

- once cooled, inoculated the F.F. with HA12(a) yeast strain from carolina biologic.
- placed the HA12(a)@YPD in incubator set to 30C, overnight, started CA 2300h
- stored petris in fridge

### Experimental Setup

09 Feb 2021

Noticeable cloudiness evolving in the YPD media.

- 1730h: inoculated 1 mL of the growth into the set aside 100 mL YPD F.F.
- 2030h: performed serial dilutions (200 uL into 800 uL pre-aliquoted from
  the set-aside 10 mL falcon into sterile Ep. tubes) of yeast growth (1x,
  5x, 25x) dilutions and plated 1x on the YP(A)D plate and 1x, 5x, 25x on
  the YPD plate, by pipetting 200 uL from the dilution into the Petris and
  spreading with sterile plastic hockey stick.

## Observations

### 10 Feb 2021

- (AM) there appear to be colonies in only the YP(A)D plate.  Is the dark YPD
media toxic?

- (PM) false alarm; the 'colonies' were air bubbles.  Good thing [experiment-2.md]
flamed the petries.  There now appears to be growth in all 4 plates, it is
apparent that there are far too many colonies in the 1x, and probably too many
in the 5x and 25x cases as well.
